#: description: Distribution of the track multiplicity $n_{\mathrm{Tracks}}$ for vertices in data events and events of five $R$-hadron signal samples with $m_{\tilde{g}} = 1.2$ TeV, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}} = 100$ GeV and and different $\tau_{\tilde{g}}$ that satisfy the signal region event requirements. All DV selections are applied except for the $m_{\mathrm{DV}}$ and track multiplicity requirements. The track multiplicity distribution requires vertices to have $m_{\mathrm{DV}}>3$ GeV.
