# Displaced Vertex Recasting #

## Authors: ##
[Andre Lessa](mailto:andre.lessa@ufabc.edu.br)

This repository holds the main code for recasting the 13 TeV ATLAS search for displaced vertices
plus missing energy ([ATLAS-SUSY-2016-08](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2016-08/))
using the efficiency grids  for event and vertex reconstruction selection provided [here](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2016-08/hepdata_info.pdf).

## Pre-Requisites ##

The following pre-requisites must be installed before compiling the main code:

  * [MadGraph5](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) with [Pythia8](https://pythia.org/) installed
  * [Modified Delphes](./DelphesLLP.tar.gz)
  
## Installation ##

Running:

```
./installer.sh
```

Should install most of the relevant (non-Mathematica) packages.
The LHAPDF, Pythia8 and Delphes directories must be included in the library and root include paths.
This can be done running:

```
source setenv.sh
```

## Running ##

The recasting accepts ROOT files generated by the modified Delphes version provided in this repository.
Examples of Delphes cards can be found in the [validation/Cards](./validation/Cards) folder.
*Note that the LLP PDG ids have to be defined in the BSMFilter block of the delphes card, so the required
LLP information is stored in the ROOT file*.
The main recasting code accepts the following options:

```
usage: atlas_susy_2016_13_Recast.py [-h] -f INPUTFILE [INPUTFILE ...] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [-n] [-v VERBOSE]

Run the recasting for ATLAS-SUSY-2018-13 using one or multiple Delphes ROOT files as input. If multiple files are given as argument, add them (the samples weights will be normalized if -n is given).
Store the cutflow and SR bins in a pickle (Pandas DataFrame) file.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f INPUTFILE [INPUTFILE ...], --inputFile INPUTFILE [INPUTFILE ...]
                        path to the ROOT event file(s) generated by Delphes.
  -o OUTPUTFILE, --outputFile OUTPUTFILE
                        path to output file storing the DataFrame with the recasting data. If not defined, will use the name of the first input file
  -n, --normalize       If set, the input files will be considered to refer to multiple samples of the same process and their weights will be normalized.
  -v VERBOSE, --verbose VERBOSE
                        verbose level (debug, info, warning or error). Default is info

```

The basic required input is a Delphes ROOT file.
For instance, running:

```
./atlas_susy_2016_08_Recast.py -f <root file>
```
will produce a pickle file contaning a Pandas DataFrame with a simplified cutflow and the number of events in each signal region.

## Validation ##

For validation information about the recasting, see the [validation folder](./validation).
