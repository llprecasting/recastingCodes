#: name: Acceptance, R-hadron, compressed
#: description: Acceptance for the R-hadron pair-production model with DeltaM(gluino, N1) = 30 GeV for various masses and lifetimes. The acceptance is defined as the fraction of events having at least one charged LLP satisfying pT > 120 GeV, |eta| < 1.8 and r_decay > 500 mm.
