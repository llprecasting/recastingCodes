#: name: Muon Reconstruction Efficiency distribution
#: description: Muon reconstruction efficiency as a function of β and |η| for (a) stable charginos and (b) stable charged R-hadrons. For weakly interacting LLPs with calorimeter materials the efficiency for the chargino is recommended to refer to. The muon reconstruction efficiency for R-hadrons is significantly lower due to having QCD interactions with materials.
