#: name: SR-Inclusive_High Effective mass
#: description: Expected and observed distributions in SR-Inclusive_High of the effective mass, defined as the scalar sum pT of the signal candidate track, jets satisfying pT > 30 GeV, excluding ones within deltaR < 0.4 with respect to the signal candidate track, and pTmiss. The expected background distribution is calculated for each |eta| slice using CR-kin control region as the template and applying the scale factor using the dE/dx distribution in CR-dEdx of the corresponding |eta| slice. The last bins of the plots include overflow events above the range.
