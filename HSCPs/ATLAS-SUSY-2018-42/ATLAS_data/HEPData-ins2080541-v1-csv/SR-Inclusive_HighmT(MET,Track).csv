#: name: SR-Inclusive_High mT(MET, Track)
#: description: Expected and observed distributions in SR-Inclusive_High of the transverse mass of pTmiss and the signal candidate track. The expected background distribution is calculated for each |eta| slice using CR-kin control region as the template and applying the scale factor using the dE/dx distribution in CR-dEdx of the corresponding |eta| slice. The last bins of the plots include overflow events above the range.
