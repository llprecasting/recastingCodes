#: name: SR-Inclusive_Low Leading jet pT
#: description: Expected and observed distributions in SR-Inclusive_Low of the leading jet pT, required to be separated by at least deltaR > 0.4 with respect to the signal candidate track. The expected background distribution is calculated for each |eta| slice using CR-kin control region as the template and applying the scale factor using the dE/dx distribution in CR-dEdx of the corresponding |eta| slice. The last bins of the plots include overflow events above the range.
