#: name: Track Selection Efficiency distribution
#: description: Signal track selection efficiency as a function of CLLP $\beta\gamma$ for SR-Inclusive_Low and SR-Inclusive_High bins. The band on the marker indicates a typical size of fluctuation by the LLP mass and lifetime observed by the samples used in efficiency derivation, but it does not indicate the full envelope of model dependence.
