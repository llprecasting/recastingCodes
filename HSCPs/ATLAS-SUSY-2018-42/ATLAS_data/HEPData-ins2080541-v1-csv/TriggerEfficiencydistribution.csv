#: name: Trigger Efficiency distribution
#: description: Trigger and event selection efficiencies. The band on the marker indicates a typical size of fluctuation by the LLP mass and lifetime observed by the samples used in efficiency derivation, but it does not indicate the full envelope of model dependence.
