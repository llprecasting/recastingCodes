# HSCP Recasting #

## Authors: ##

This repository holds the main code for recasting the 13 TeV ATLAS heavy stable charged particle
search ([ATLAS-SUSY-2018-42](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/SUSY-2018-42/))
based on the recasting details and code provided [here](https://doi.org/10.17182/hepdata.127994.v1/r1) .

## Pre-Requisites ##

The following pre-requisites must be installed before compiling the main code:

  * [Pythia8](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/pythia8/) (with ROOT bindings)

## Installation/Compiling ##

In order to compile the recasting code for the R-hadron searches, run:

```
make main_Rhadron.exe pythia8path=<PATH-TO-PYTHIA8FOLDER>
```

where PATH-TO-PYTHIA8FOLDER should point to the Pythia8 folder containing the Pythia lib and include folders.
The recasting code for the color neutral (HSCP) searches can be compiled through:

```
make main_HSCP.exe pythia8path=<PATH-TO-PYTHIA8FOLDER>
```


## Running ##

Instructions for running the main code can be obtained running:

```
./main_HSCP.exe -h  or ./main_Rhadron.exe -h
```

The basic required input is a (parton level) LHE or SLHA file.
For instance, running:

```
./main_HSCP.exe -f example.slha -n 100
```

should generate 100 events and display the efficiencies for the given input file.
Notice that for R-hadron searches the Pythia configuration file (pythia8.cfg) may have to be adapted
in order to properly specify the hadronization properties of the new long-lived colored BSM particles.


## Validation ##

The validation of the signal efficiencies (efficiency times acceptance) can be found in the [validation folder](validation).
The efficiencies were computed using the SLHA files and the pythia8_xx.cfg file stored in the folder.
The following validation plot can be generated running this [ipython notebook](validation/validationGluino.ipynb):

* *The values provided by ATLAS for small lifetime values (< 50 ns) for the gluino R-hadron benchmark could not be validated.
  Therefore we recommend to use the results with care*. The comparison between the ATLAS efficiencies (Table 6) and 
  the ones obtained through the recasting code for a few benchmarks is shown below:

  | gluino Mass | gluino lifetime | ATLAS eff. | Recasting eff. |
  | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
  |   1 TeV     |      10 ns      |   0.065    |   0.015        |
  |   1 TeV     |      30 ns      |   0.121    |   0.076        |
  |   1 TeV     |      50 ns      |   0.125    |   0.101        |
  |   2 TeV     |      10 ns      |   0.060    |   0.023        |
  |   2 TeV     |      30 ns      |   0.132    |   0.116        |
  |   2 TeV     |      50 ns      |   0.146    |   0.160        |
