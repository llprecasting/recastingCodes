#: name: Mass Limit vs. Lifetime, R-hadron, Observed
#: description: Lower limits on the gluino mass, from gluino $R$-hadron pair production, as a function of gluino lifetime for two neutralino mass assumptions of (a) $m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}) = 100 \text{GeV}$ and (b) $\Delta m(\tilde{g}, \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}) = 30 \text{GeV}$. The upper $1 \sigma_\text{exp}$ expected bound is very close to the expected limit for some lifetime values due to the expected background getting very close to 0 events.
